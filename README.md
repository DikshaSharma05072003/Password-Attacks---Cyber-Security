# Password-Attacks---Cyber-Security

Conducted a comprehensive password attack using various tools and techniques. Utilized Hydra for brute-force attacks, Auxiliary Mode for targeted exploitation, and NSE Scripts for network security testing. Employed John the Ripper for password cracking and used Crunch for generating custom password lists. This project showcases my proficiency in cybersecurity and penetration testing.
